Possible combinations can be calculated by the following function:

combinations(n, r) {
  return factorial(n)/factorial(r) - factorial(n-r)
}

"n" : number of items
"r" : number of items being chosen at a time

factorial(n) {
  return (n != 1) ? n * factorial(n - 1) : 1;
}


Should we create a single template for ? For example:

Template1: Is the temperature outside <less, lower, smaller than>
Template2: Is the temperature outside <more, higher, bigger, larger than>
